** DTC control page (HTML/javasctipt) implemented
** node_frontend implemented and deployed
* <2024-12-25 Wed>                                                           
** subdetector configuration framework implemented
** version 1 of the monitoring pages deployed (Mark Vakulenko)

** python-based access to postgresql DB re-established (Namitha)             
- if for the active configuration, UseRuninfoDB=1, the run numbers come from runinfo DB
- to request a run number, use Sequencer script get_next_run_number
- details: file:runinfodb.org
** first version of the configuration frontend implemented (python)          
- at this point, it sends begin run and end run messages to elog
- source: file:../conf/mu2e_config_fe.py

- as ARTDAQ_PARTITION_NUMBER is used only for the port assignment, make is a global variable, 
  /Mu2e/ARTDAQ_PARTITION_NUMBER, not a part of a configuration
* <2024-02-09 Fri>                                                           
- [[file:../dtc_frontend/dtc_frontend.cc][dtc_frontend]] updated to include monitoring of the DTC registers

- a number of updates to frontends merged into to the main branch :
- all Mu2e-specific configuration parameters moved to a single top-level subtree- /Mu2e in ODB 
- the subtree is saved in git and could be loaded from  https://github.com/pavel1murat/frontends/blob/main/odb/Mu2e/Mu2e.json
- there are two monitoring frontends per DAQ node , one monitoring both DTC's and another one - the artdaq processes
- variable number of ARTDAQ processes per node is suported
- if PostgreSQL is used, the start and the end of each  transition are recorded  there
- TFM is submitted via SCREEN - done by Simon, SCREEN is really cool! 
- unification of the FCL file names in all examples: 
to facilitate assigning names to the monitoring variables,
- all boardreader FCL name have been changed to brXX.fcl, i.e. br01.fcl etc 
- event builder FCL file names became ebXX.fcl, data logger - to dlXX.fcl, dispatcher - dsXX.fcl
*** all frontend scripts moved to https://github.com/pavel1murat/frontends/blob/main/scripts subdirectory
* <2023-06-29 Thu> ROOT interface to DTC available
