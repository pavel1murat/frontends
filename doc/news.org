* <2024-02-08 Thu> a number of updates to frontends merged into to the main branch :
*** all Mu2e-specific configuration parameters moved to a single top-level subtree- /Mu2e in ODB 
*** the subtree is saved in git and could be loaded from  https://github.com/pavel1murat/frontends/blob/main/odb/Mu2e/Mu2e.json
*** there are two monitoring frontends per DAQ node , one monitoring both DTC's and another one - the artdaq processes
*** variable number of ARTDAQ processes per node is suported
*** if PostgreSQL is used, the start and the end of each  transition are recorded  there
*** TFM is submitted via SCREEN - an idea by Simon, SCREEN is really cool! 
*** unification of the FCL file names in all examples: 
  to facilitate assigning names to the monitoring variables,
- all boardreader FCL name have been changed to brXX.fcl, i.e. br01.fcl etc 
- event builder FCL file names became ebXX.fcl, data logger - to dlXX.fcl, dispatcher - dsXX.fcl
