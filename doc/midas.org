** elog                                                                      
*** built-in elog                                                            
- The built-in elog data are stored in the directory defined by the "/Logger/Elog dir" ODB key. 
- If that is not defined, the built-in elog directory is defined by the "/Logger/Data dir" ODB key.
** Equipment update thresholds - slow controls                               
- in the "Equipment/XXX/Settings/Update Threshold" the defaults are set to 0.1
- for low voltages, the update thresholds may need to be customized
** sequencer                                                                 
- location of the sequencer scripts: key="/Sequencer/State/Path"
- proposed for Mu2e: $experiment/online/sequencer
- scripts should be copied there from [[file:../sequencer][frontends/sequencer]] directory, which is 
  a revision-controled area
** history                                                                   
- location of the files:                                                     
- key="/Logger/History dir"
